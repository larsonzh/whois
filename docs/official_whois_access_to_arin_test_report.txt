官方 whois 客户端 IPv4/6 协议访问 whois.arin.net 服务器测试报告

whois 客户端 host 设置为 whois.arin.net 域名时，whois 客户端会以 IPv4 协议连接 ARIN 服务器 43 端口。
whois 客户端 host 设置为 whois.arin.net 的 IPv6 地址时，whois 客户端会以 IPv6 协议连接 ARIN 服务器 43 端口。

当前的运营商网络会屏蔽 IPv4 协议访问 whois.arin.net 的 43 端口，不会屏蔽 IPv6 协议访问 whois.arin.net 的 43 端口，但官方 whois 客户端不会受运营商网络屏蔽策略的影响，在 host 设置为 whois.arin.net 域名时，依然能够以 IPv4 协议连接 ARIN 服务器 43 端口。

ARIN's WHOIS service provides a mechanism for finding contact and registration
information for resources registered with ARIN. ARIN's database contains IP
addresses, autonomous system numbers, organizations, or customers that are
associated with these resources, and related Points of Contact [POC].

ARIN's WHOIS will NOT locate any domain related information, nor any
information relating to military networks. Please use whois.internic.net to
locate domain information, and whois.nic.mil for military network information.

Many operating systems provide a whois utility. To conduct a query from the
command line, such as:
    whois -h hostname <query string>
    (e.g. whois -h whois.arin.net foo)

To obtain a more specific response, you may conduct a search by using certain
flags. Many of these flags can be combined to tailor the desired output.
Flags must be separated from each other and from the search term by a space.
Your results will vary depending on the refinements you apply in your search.
Listed below are the flags currently available; you may only use one flag from
each flag-type in a query, i.e. one record type, one attribute, etc.


Query-by-record-type:
---------------------
To limit your query to a specific record type, include one of the following
flags:
      n       Network address space
      r       CIDRized network space
      d       Delegations
      a       Autonomous systems
      p       Points-of-contact
      o       Organizations
      c       End-user customers
      e       Points-of-contact, Organizations, End-user customers
      z       All of the above


Query-by-attribute:
-------------------
To limit your query to a specific record attribute, include one of the
following flags:
      @<domain name>     Searches for matches by domain-portion of an
                         email address
      ! <handle>         Searches for matches by handle or id
      / <name>           Searches for matches by name
      . <name>           Searches for matches by name
                         (same as above, but some WHOIS clients have problems with)

Searches that retrieve a single record will display the full record. Searches
that retrieve more than one record will be displayed in list output.


Display flags:
--------------
To modify the way that the query results display, include one of the
following flags:
      +       FULL output shows detailed display for EACH match
      -       LIST output shows summary only, even if single match
              returned

The + flag cannot be used with the sub-query features described below.


Record hierarchy:
-----------------
Records in the ARIN WHOIS database have hierarchical relationships with other
records. To display those related records, use the following flags:

      <       Displays the record related up the hierarchy. For a network,
              display the supernet, or parent network in detailed format.
      >       Displays the record related down the hierarchy. For a network,
              display the subdelegations, or subnets, below the network, in
              list format. For an organization or customer, display the
              resources registered to that organization or customer, in
              list format.
      =       Display only an exact match in the hierarchy.


Wild card queries:
------------------
WHOIS supports wild card queries. This feature is only supported as a trailing
character option. To take advantage of this append the query with an asterisk
[*]. This can also be used in combination with any flags defined above.


Other helpful hints:
--------------------
To guarantee matching only a single record, look it up by its handle using a
handle-only search.  In the record summary line, the handle is shown in
parenthesis after the name.

When using a handle to conduct a search for POC information, be sure to add
the -ARIN extension.

Queries that return more than 256
results will stop displaying data after the limit has been reached for each
record type. You may want to narrow your search criteria or add flags to your
query to limit the results.    

To search on an individual's name, you may enter the last name, or to further
restrict results, use the last name and first name, separated by a comma. For
example: Smith, John.


Contact us:
-----------
For operational problems with WHOIS please contact noc@arin.net with the
appropriate details.

To correct information within your area of responsibility, submit a template
to hostmaster@arin.net. Information on how to fill out the appropriate template
can be found at: http://www.arin.net/resources/guide/request/documentation/

To notify ARIN of invalid POC information, contact hostmaster@arin.net with
the relevant information.

结论：IPv4/6 连接时，所查 IPv4/6 地址项归属于 ARIN 的前提下，在查询词前增加 "n + =" 标志，确实能保证获得完整信息，同时能消除查询词不明确的提示（Query terms are ambiguous.）。


4. 测试 CIDR 查询

如下进行归属于 ARIN 网段 IPv4 连接的 CIDR 查询：

CMD: whois -h whois.arin.net 8.8.8.0/24

如上所示，使用 IPv6 连接查询归属于 ARIN 的网段时出现查询词不明确的信息，并出现 "r < 8.8.8.0/24" 的提示，输出的信息很少，非常不完整。按照提示，在查询项前增加标志，再次执行归属于 ARIN 网段的 IPv6 连接的 CIDR 查询：

修改查询项前的标志后，在 IPv6 连接时消除了查询词不明确的提示信息，并获得非常完整的查询信息。

查询项前增加标志 "r + ="，再次执行执行归属于 ARIN 网段的 IPv4 连接的 CIDR 查询：

修改查询项前的标志后，在 IPv6 连接时获得的查询信息非常完整。

查询项前增加标志 "a + ="，再次执行归属于 ARIN 的 IPv6 连接的 ASN 查询：

CMD: whois -h whois.arin.net "a + = AS15169"

如上所示，查询项前增加标志 "a + ="，对归属于 ARIN 的 IPv4 连接的 ASN 查询结果无影响。

结论：IPv4/6 连接时， 查询归属于 ARIN 的 ASN 项时，在查询词前增加 "a + =" 标志，确实能保证获得完整信息，同时能消除查询词不明确的提示（Query terms are ambiguous.）。


6. 测试 NetHandle 查询

如下进行归属于 ARIN 的 IPv4 连接的 NetHandle 查询：

CMD: whois -h whois.arin.net NET-8-8-8-0-2

#
# Query terms are ambiguous.  The query is assumed to be:
#     "n ! net-8-8-8-0-2"
#
# Use "?" to get help.

如上所示，查询项前增加标志 "n + = !"，无查询词不明确的提示信息，归属于 ARIN 的 IPv6 连接的 NetHandle 查询结果信息依然完整，与查询项前使用相同标志的 IPv4 连接时的 NetHandle 查询结果一致。

结论：IPv4/6 连接时， 查询归属于 ARIN 的 NetHandle 项时，在查询词前增加 "n + =" 标志，能保证获得完整信息，同时能消除查询词不明确的提示（Query terms are ambiguous.）。

7. 测试非 ARIN 归属查询项查询

1) APNIC 查询项

使用 IPv4 连接查询归属于 APNIC 的地址信息：

如上所示，查询词不明确信息消失，到 whois.apnic.net 的引用信息依然存在，但没有输出 APNIC 的查询结果信息，原因是查询项前的查询标志仅对归属于 ARIN 的查询项有效，APNIC 不支持和无法识别 "标志 + 查询项" 组合后的查询项，导致无法得到查询项在 APNIC 的注册信息。

启示：可以利用到 whois.apnic.net 的引用信息进行重定向查询。

如上所示，出现查询词不明确信息，并给出 "r < 1.1.1.0/24" 提示。官方 whois 客户端使用 IPv6 协议查询非 ARIN 归属地址时能够通过到 whois.apnic.net 的引用信息，重定向到该地址的权威 RIR 查询，输出完整的查询结果信息。

无查询词不明确信息，输出中包含到 whois.afrinic.net 的引用信息，官方 whois 客户端未进一步输出该地址在 AFRINIC 的完整注册信息。

启示：可以利用到 whois.afrinic.net 的引用信息进行重定向查询。


8. 总结

为使用 IPv4/IPv6 协议访问 whois.arin.net 服务器 43 端口，查询归属于 ARIN 的查询项时能真正获取到来自 whois.arin.net 的完整信息，针对查询项类型，应在查询项前合理添加 ARIN 专属查询标志。该标志仅对 ARIN 的信息查询有效，且查询项内容也必须隶属于 ARIN，其它 RIR 不支持 ARIN 专属查询标志。同一查询项在 IPv4 和 IPv6 协议时均可采用相同的查询标志。

查询项为 IP 地址时，查询项标志："n + ="，例如："n + = 8.8.8.8"，"n + = 2001:4860:4860::8888"。
查询项为 CIDR 格式时，查询标志："r + ="，例如："r + = 8.8.8.0/24"。
查询项为 ASN 时，查询标志："a + ="，例如："a + = AS15169"。
查询项为 NetHandle 时，查询标志："n + = !"，例如："n + = ! NET-8-8-8-0-2"。

在 whois 项目中，应对访问 whois.arin.net 服务器的查询项内容进行检测，若发现查询项中不含 ARIN 查询标志，则应先检查并判断查询项类型，然后按上述内容分类和字符组合方式将查询标志置于查询项中。

如果查询项内容不隶属于 ARIN，添加查询标志后也无法从 whois.arin.net 获取到完整有效的待查信息。根据查询项内容的类型，whois.arin.net 会在输出信息中给出到某 RIR 的地址引用，或者给出未找到匹配结果的提示（如：No match found for r + = 1.1.1.0/24.）。

在 whois 项目中，若从 whois.arin.net 输出信息中检测出到某 RIR 的地址引用，应立刻使用不含查询标志的原始查询项，重定向到该 RIR 地址进行查询；若以大小写不敏感方式在 whois.arin.net 输出信息中检测到 "No match found for" 关键字，则应立刻使用不含查询标志的原始查询项，重定向到 whois.iana.org 查询。
